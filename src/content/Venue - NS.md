## Novi Sad

The City of Novi Sad is the administrative, economic, cultural, scientific and touristic centre of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, stretched along the fruitful Pannonian Basin. It is the second largest city in Serbia, with between 300 and 400 thousand citizens.
Novi Sad lies on the Danube River waterway and it is located on the 1,225th kilometer of the Danube flow. The river Danube gives specific and recognizable character to the City. The city Quay alongside the Danube brushes the edges of the University of Novi Sad campus and is loved by the people of Novi Sad for the walks and recreational activities.

With its 300-year history, Novi Sad is the multinational, multicultural and multi-confessional European city. It has come to be recognized by the Exit Festival, famous especially among the young Europeans. It is also famous for the oldest cultural institution of Serbia – Matica srpska, and the Serbian National Theater, among others. The galleries and museums in the City offer interesting and colorful view at Novi Sad from a different angle.
Finally, one of the most recognizable elements of Novi Sad is certainly the Petrovaradin Fortress, a historical site located on the right bank of the Danube.
In a vicinity of Novi Sad lies the mountain of Fruška gora, one of the Serbian national parks, which is the home of over a dozen Serbian Orthodox monasteries dating back to the period between the 12th and the 15th century. They have the status of the monuments of culture of exceptional importance of the Republic of Serbia and many of them are the usual visiting points on the tourist routes.
