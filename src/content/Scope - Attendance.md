## School attendance

This is a truly international school open to a maximum of 60 students from all over the world. The priority is given to students from Universities in Danube region, and students from emerging countries. Since a second very important aim is to promote future collaborations between young physicists working in the same or similar areas of research, students from the technically advanced regions worldwide are also welcome. 

Possible grants may be provided for the best students from emerging countries.
