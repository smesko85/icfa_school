## School attendance

This is a truly international school open to a maximum of 80 students from all over the world. Since the main goal of the ICFA Instrumentation Schools is to stimulate particle physics instrumentation in all parts of the world, at least half of the students come from regions of the world that are technically unprivileged. Since a second very important aim is to promote future collaborations between these young physicists and their peers, including those who come from the more developed countries, we also accept students from the technically advanced regions of the world.

The best students from emerging countries will be selected and offered with a few months fellowship to be spent in one of the major HEP Laboratory.
