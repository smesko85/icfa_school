## School formula

The school in Colombia, that spans two weeks, will continue what has by now become a tradition. Lecture courses in the morning that cover different topics in particle physics instrumentation and are given by researchers who are actively involved in the field and who are recognized to be experts in detector development. The lecture courses are supported by 9 afternoons of ``hands-on" participation in laboratory experiments designed to demonstrate the material presented.

When possible, part of the material used for the laboratory courses is left in place and used by the local organizers for their University laboratories or to organize regional schools in the years following the ICFA schools (see Morelia and Istanbul regional schools).
