## School formula

_“Danube School on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle & Nuclear Physics”_, jointly organized by CERN, ECFA, ICFA and the University of Novi Sad, will continue the tradition of offering schools with lectures and “hands-on” exercises on instrumentation in particle and nuclear physics. This one week school will bring together lecture courses and practical exercises, both held by eminent researchers and professors actively involved in the field of particle and nuclear physics. All laboratory experiments are designed to demonstrate the material presented within lecture session.
