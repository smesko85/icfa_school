## Travel Info

### Coming to Serbia and Novi Sad

#### By plane
Belgrade Airport “Nikola Tesla” is 18 kilometers away from the Belgrade city centre (Airport-Belgrade) and some 80 kilometers from Novi Sad. If you are coming by plane, for additional information about the Airport please visit: [http://www.beg.aero](http://www.beg.aero).

_TAXI TRANSFER to Novi Sad_: You can order the transfer service from and to Belgrade airport from various travel agencies in Novi Sad. Price can vary from 1800 RSD to 5000 RSD depending if it is calculated per person or per vehicle (vans or cars).

_BUS TRANSFER to Belgrade city centre_: You can take minibus line A1 or PTC Belgrade Line 72. For additional information please see: [http://www.beg.aero/to_&_from_the_airport/bus.326.html](http://www.beg.aero/to_&_from_the_airport/bus.326.html). Taxi service to Belgrade is also available and prices are regulated (ask at the information desk at arrival). 

_GETTING FROM BELGRADE TO NOVI SAD_: You can take train from the Belgrade train station, or bus from the main bus station. The train runs daily in different intervals. However, we do not recommend using trains as they are the least reliable means of transportation. For the timetable please visit: [http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/](http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/). If you take a bus from the main bus station, we recommend traveling by those which take the faster (highway) road. The journey usually lasts between 80 to 120 minutes, depending on the route and traffic.

_WHEN IN NOVI SAD_: Novi Sad rail and bus stations are located in vicinity of each other and are well connected to the Novi Sad city centre where Hotel “Putnik” is located. You can take bus line 4 (the bus tickets can be bought in the vehicle) or a taxi (avoid offers from unregistered taxis) from the station to your Hotel. If you are staying in the Hotel “Putnik” and you take a bus, you should get off in the City Centre, from where it takes around 5 minutes on foot to arrive to the Hotel.
